# LogicGates
Idk, It's a way of describing logic gate arrays

There are 4 things:

- Gates: have inputs and outputs, when an input changes, they update their output accordingly
- inputs: Can hold true/ false, when set push updates to all connected connections
- outputs: Receive output from gates/ inputs, you get it
- connections: relay changes in input to gates
